# Hydroponic-System
Our project aims to  revolutionize plant cultivation by providing an efficient, sustainable,  and technologically advanced solution for hydroponic farming. 
It focuses on developing a remote monitoring hydroponic 
system using sensors and an ESP32 microcontroller. The system incorporates 
sensors like PIR, DHT11, DS18S20, and a water level switch to 
monitor temperature, humidity, motion, and water levels in real-time. 
By transmitting data to the Blynk IoT app via Wi-Fi, growers can 
remotely monitor and control their hydroponic setups from anywhere. 
The user-friendly interface of the Blynk app allows for easy access to 
vital information and enables growers to optimize environmental 
conditions for maximum plant growth.
